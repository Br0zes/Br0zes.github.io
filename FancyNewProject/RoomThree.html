		<h1>Victory</h1>
		<p>
			As you drop the last disk in place a click is heard, and with a low rumble the door begins to slowly slide open.<br>
			When you enter the room you notice something strange. The door at the end of the room is wide open. a stone plaque sits alone in this empty room. The plaque reads <p Class="write"> “I couldn’t think of a good third riddle. The treasure is yours, just tell anyone that ask that the third riddle was really clever and hard, Thanks. I just spent way to much time trying to paint the disk in the last room I thought two riddles was enough.” </p><br>
			You walk into the final room to see the treasure you spent years looking for. You celebrate your victory and think about resetting the watch to <a class="option" href="Entrance.html">do it all over again.</a>
