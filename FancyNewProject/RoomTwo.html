		<h1>Room Two</h1>
		<p>
			You reach for the door and push against it. The door slowly slides open scraping the ground under its own weight.<br>The next room is similar to the last except for a table sized stone block, and singular stone door. No matter how hard you push against it the door doesnâ€™t budge. You make your way to the table and notice three different disks and three holes that they fit in perfectly.<br>There are two green disks, one with a <span style="color:green;">horse</span> painted on it and one with a <span style="color:green;">cat</span>, the last disk is a red one with a <span style="color:red;">cat</span> painted on it.<br>Carved in the table it says:</p><p Class="write">1. To the right of the red disk is one or two green disks<br>2. Directly left of a green disk is a green disk<br>3. To the left of a cat is one or two green disks</p><p>After applying the first rule you managed to whittle the possibilities down to only four outcomes.
